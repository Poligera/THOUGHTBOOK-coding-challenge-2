    ('Pleats will come back', 'Marylou', 'I loved the dress that I bought at a flea market. It fit perfectly, and the skirt was a swirl of intricate pleats. I wore it confidently to an evening party and glowed when a woman exclaimed, "Oh, how stunning!" Yes, I was grinning from ear to ear, until she added cheerfully, "Hang on to it, honey. Pleats will come back someday."'),
    ('My newspaper was different', 'Eddie', 'A customer walked into my clothing shop and asked to see the pants that were advertised in the paper that day. "We dont have an ad in the paper today." I told her. She insisted I was wrong, so I got a copy of the paper, and we went through it, eventually landing on an ad for pants from another local store. Exasperated, the customer glared at me and said, "In my newspaper, the ad was for this store!"')
